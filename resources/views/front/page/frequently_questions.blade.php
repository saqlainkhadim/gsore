                                      You can use the ISO file to create bootable media for installation
                                      or recovery. You can also install Windows on your current device
                                      by opening the ISO file, selecting the Setup and following the
                                      instructions.

                                      To create bootable media such as a bootable USB drive or DVD, you
                                      will need an ISO burning or mounting software. We recommend always
                                      using a blank USB or blank DVD because contents may be deleted
                                      when creating a bootable image.

                                      version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory
                                      (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system. Not all devices can
